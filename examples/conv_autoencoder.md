# The Problem

Encode the MNIST data set.

# The Data

Uses the [MNIST](http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/datasets.html#mnist)
class to acquire 70,000 28X28 images in 10 categories---one for each digit.

# The Model

The model consists of convolutional and pooling layers followed by
deconvolution layers.

Upon completion of training, the code produces an image file,
`Reconstructed.png` illustrating the outputs generated by the final layer,
following the last batch of inputs.

# Local Training

`python conv_autoencoder.py`

# Nervana Cloud Training
